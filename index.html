                    <p class="class5">The invention of the telephone provided an important device for facilitating human communication. Today, the telephone is used as a one-way broadcasting medium for transmitting recorded messages. Telephone operators played an important role in directing telephone calls and performing troubleshooting activities as well.</p>
                    <p class="class5">The telephone is an instrument used to transmit and receive sounds, most commonly the human voice. The word telephone comes from the Greek words tele meaning far and phone meaning voice. The history of the telephone is controversial because although many inventors were involved in performing pioneering experiments in voice transmission over a wire, only Alexander Graham Bell obtained a patent for the telephone in March 1876.</p>
                    <p class="class5">Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the invention of the telephone in 1876. Elisha Gray, 1876, designed a telephone using a water microphone in Highland Park, Illinois. Tivadar Puskás proposed the telephone switchboard exchange in 1876.</p>

                    <h3 class="class6">The First Telephone</h3>
                    <p class="class5">The Centennial Model is so labeled because it was first demonstrated on June 25, 1876 at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Bell said to the public that he would show them “something which would speak”. In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental telephone call. Calling from the AT&T head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City, Bell was heard by Thomas Watson at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. The words which he first spoke on the phone were addressed to his assistant Mr Watson “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.”</p>
                    <p class="class5">This instrument was a more refined version of the original Gallows Model. The hinged armature was replaced with an iron disk glued directly to the parchment diaphragm, which improved the instrument’s performance. However, parchment is rather hygroscopic, and in just a few minutes of talking can absorb enough moisture from the breath to cause the material to lose its original drum-like tautness. It becomes limp. When this happens, sound quality quickly deteriorates, and the iron disk soon latches magnetically onto the electromagnet - and conversation stops. This was an inherent problem with all of the early parchment-based transmitters.</p>
